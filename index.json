A significant decrease in sensitivity has been seen in some gamma-ray detectors as they age as a result of this damage. Performance degradation due to such damage is characterized by a signal change from the detector, which shifts to lower energy, and ultimately a reduction in the ability to detect gamma radiation. This degradation is due to the permeation of water into the plastic, which can then cause temporary fogging and permanent damage to the material. As an example, a 1-mm thick barrier of high-density polyethylene with an area of 1 m2 would allow 5 g per year of water transmission at 100% relative humidity. Thus, significant amounts of water can penetrate plastics over time and provide the potential for damage to the plastic. Such damage to plastic scintillator can cause problems for radiation detection applications in uncontrolled environments. Mitigation approaches that have been proposed to prevent damage to plastic scintillator include encapsulation of the plastic scintillator to prevent water intrusion that leads to damage during cold cycles. It is concluded that an encapsulation material with a moisture vapor transmission rate on the order of 10−4 gm−2dor better is needed for protecting large pieces of plastic scintillator from fogging over years of use. This paper presents information on testing of bare and encapsulated plastic scintillator samples and on diagnostic approaches to measure the nature and progression of the fogging condition. It is shown that several encapsulation approaches fail to prevent water intrusion, while a couple methods can successfully encapsulate plastic and prevent water from penetrating the plastic and producing fogging.","tags":["nuclear"],"title":"Investigations of degradation and encapsulation of plastic scintillator","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gerges Dib","Surajit Roy","Pradeep Ramuhalli","Jangbom Chai"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1547452800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1547452800,"objectID":"b0d6cf5f9ea795900029ecd8f8b67a52","permalink":"https://dibgerge.github.io/publication/2019-net/","publishdate":"2019-01-14T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-net/","section":"publication","summary":"Second harmonic generation using nonlinear ultrasonic waves have been shown to be an early indicator of possible fatigue damage in nuclear power plant components.

This work is part of an ongoing effort to define best practices required for using computational models for ultrasonic testing (UT) reliability applications. In addition to model validity (i.e., the ability of a model to accurately reproduce all conditions of interest for a particular application), a number of other factors need to be taken into account, such as computational complexity, uncertainty in model predictions, and the ability to extrapolate findings from model predictions to realistic scenarios. In this part of the ongoing effort, we focus on beam modeling and evaluating the use of both beam models and flaw models for simulating weld inspections. We evaluate the dynamic ray tracing model capability for handling smoothly varying heterogeneous materials, as this approach is often applied for simulating UT behavior in weld geometries. Two types of beam models based on two commercial simulation software platforms common to the NDE nuclear industry, CIVA and UltraVision, are compared. The two software platforms implement different approaches to modeling the ultrasound beam, and this assessment assumes correctness of the implementation. Differences observed in the computed beam between the two software platforms are not surprising, given that different types of models are being compared. The dynamic ray tracing model (CIVA implementation of beam models) is used to evaluate beam simulation of austenitic weld inspection. This is done by attempting to reproduce empirically measured sound beams using simulations. Challenges in this approach are seen due to the complexity of weld modeling and the large number of parameters required to define welds. The correlation between beam amplitude incident onto flaws and the expected response amplitude from the flaw is also investigated. Beam simulations using 23 different types of single and dual-element probes are used to extract an amplitude metric representing the sound beam amplitude incident onto flaws of different dimensions. Then, this metric is compared with the maximum expected response amplitudes from circumferentially oriented crack-like flaws of different depths. This study shows the complex relationship between flaw scattering and incident beams, thus limiting the interpretability of beam simulations for NDE reliability. Different types of normalizations and methods to quantify access limitations are also considered in this study. To further understand the ability to use flaw models to simulate ultrasonic weld inspection, a welded specimen with a machined reflector (saw-cut flaw) was scanned using different types of transducers. Those measurements are compared with simulated results using the dynamic ray tracing model in CIVA. This work illustrates the importance and the necessity for requiring well characterized weld properties as model inputs. Finally, initial work in transducer characterization is conducted to illustrate the possible variations in performance of transducers that have similar specifications. This study shows that even with the same transducer specifications and manufacturers, the frequency response and near-field distance of transducers can vary significantly. This variance is likely to have a direct effect on signal-to-noise ratio and must be taken into account when conducting model-based studies of ultrasonic inspections.","tags":["nuclear","NDE","ultrasound"],"title":"Ultrasound Modeling and Simulation: Status Update","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Introduction Consider a function (f(x)) represented by the curve in Figure 1.

We identify appropriate features for damage detection and introduce a feature aggregation method which quadratically increases the number of available training observations. We adopt a two-level voting scheme by using an ensemble of classifiers and predictions. Each classifier is trained on a different segment of the guided wave signal, and each classifier makes an ensemble of predictions based on a single observation. Using this approach, the classifier can be trained using a small number of baseline signals. We study the performance using Monte-Carlo simulations of an analytical model and data from impact damage experiments on a glass fiber composite plate. We also demonstrate the classifier performance using two types of baseline signals: fixed and rolling baseline training set.

AdvRx concepts include small modular reactors (SMRs) where the electrical output of a module is generally less than 300 MWe, and Gen-IV reactors that utilize non-light water as coolants for heat removal from the reactor core. Several of these AdvRx concepts incorporate challenging environments for sensors, with core outlet temperatures in excess of 500°C, fast-spectrum neutrons that can accelerate damage of materials and sensors, and corrosive coolant environments. In nuclear power plants, information on component condition and the failure probability associated with degraded components is considered critical to maintaining adequate safety margins and avoiding unplanned shutdowns, both of which have regulatory and economic consequences. In AdvRx, the relatively smaller levels of operational experience (when compared with the existing fleet of light-water-cooled reactors) and limited knowledge of physics-of-failure mechanisms in AdvRx environments, when combined with the potential for increased degradation rates, point to the need for enhanced situational awareness with respect to critical systems and components. Key to enhanced situational awareness in these plants will be sensors that can survive the extreme environments (temperatures between 500°C and about 900°C, lifetime fast neutron fluences in excess of about 1020 neutrons/cm2), algorithms for diagnostics of system or component condition and prediction of remaining lifetimes, and techniques for informed decision making that enable optimal decisions on plant operations and maintenance actions. This paper describes recent and ongoing research that addresses these challenges. While the application context for these developments is in the nuclear power community, we believe that these developments can be applied to meet emergent needs in a number of different application spaces.","tags":["NDE","Nuclear","ultrasound"],"title":"Challenges and Solutions in SHM for Nuclear Power Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gerges Dib","Samuel Sexton","Matthew Prowant","Susan Crawford","Aaron Diaz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1500534000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1500534000,"objectID":"ab2c1753330ff6256b0847d36943596f","permalink":"https://dibgerge.github.io/publication/2017-qnde/","publishdate":"2017-07-20T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-qnde/","section":"publication","summary":"Computer modeling and simulation is becoming pervasive within the non-destructive evaluation (NDE) industry as a convenient tool for designing and assessing inspection techniques.

The purpose of this research is to determine if UT computational models adequately represent reality, within their intended domain of application. This work attempts to assess the reliability of such models by directly comparing them to empirical measurements. We propose a framework that allows assessing the model by using both qualitative and quantitative validation indicators and metrics. This framework acknowledges the presence of errors and uncertainties in all models and experiments, and the quantitative validation stage uses a statistical approach that incorporates uncertainties to infer the adequacy of the model. This framework is used to assess the adequacy of CIVA-UT Version 11 to model conventional ultrasonic nondestructive examination inspections. The validation study considers simple geometrical reflectors in isotropic, fine-grained, homogeneous materials with conventional ultrasonic transducers. In particular, wrought stainless steel plates with electro-discharge machined notch reflectors varying in length, depth, and orientation (tilt from the normal) are evaluated. Different types of conventional ultrasonic transducers are investigated, including different wave modes, beam angles, and frequencies. In the qualitative analysis, the model prediction results were compared with empirical data in terms of the similarity of the relevant [visual] features of C-scan, B-scan, and A-scan images. Overall, the most prominently observed differences could be attributed to uncertainties in the validation process itself including uncertainties in model parameters, and measurement noise. On the other hand, the quantitative analysis considered a metric that computes the effective amplitude of the flaw response under uncertainties in model parameters and measurement noise. The validation results show that the models in CIVA were reasonably accurate in representing their empirical counterparts in a qualitative fashion. However, when comparing the results based on the quantitative metric employed in this study, there were large variances in accuracy and the associated empirical and simulation uncertainties were significantly large. Thus, we conclude that using models for applications that require quantitative reasoning (such as predicting the detectability of small flaws or model-assisted probability of detection studies) is rather unreliable and errors over 20 dB could occur. Ultimately models need to be assessed on whether they can be used to predict if an inspector can find a flaw in a component. The quantitative analysis results show that using models to give definitive decisions about the detectability of flaws would be challenging due to the significant number of variables in the modeling process. This problem will be further addressed in the future by providing bounds on uncertainties and specifying guidelines for the modeling process.

This requires an analysis of credible aging degradation mechanisms that could contribute to a release of radiological material into the environment. In many cases, the technical data needed to resolve the significance of potential aging degradation mechanisms my not yet exist. Thus, one of the key objectives of the Used Fuel Disposition Campaign (UFDC) within the Fuel Cycle Research and Development (FCR\u0026D) program is to acquire the technical data necessary to support eventual licensing for extended periods. This work focuses specifically on methods for detecting and measuring water inside of dry cask storage systems (DCSSs) via sensors mounted exterior to the confinement boundary and requiring no physical penetration of the confinement boundary. Ideally, the environment inside of a DCSS confinement is inert and free of water to prevent potential corrosion of used fuel cladding or other internal hardware. However, there is some uncertainty about the amount of residual water potentially left behind in a DCSS as a result of drying processes. Considering the complex spatial and time dependent temperature profiles in dry storage casks, water may be in liquid or gas phase depending on where it is located in the cask and how long the cask has been in storage. A review of drying specifications by several vendors concludes that if the specifications are followed correctly, the residual moisture left behind in DCSSs should present an insignificant risk to cladding degradation. A more recent analysis has concluded that much larger quantities of residual water could remain in DCSSs, but the amount would still not be expected to lead to significant corrosion of fuel cladding or other internal components. However, assumptions about the possible quantities of residual water or their potential significance have not yet been corroborated with field experience for periods of extended storage. The measurement techniques described here can facilitate the direct observation of residual water in the field and, thus, help establish operational data that can inform operating and licensing decisions for extended periods of storage. The proposed measurement techniques are based on the application of ultrasonic signals propagated through the confinement boundary with sensors mounted on the exterior of the confinement boundary. This paper will consider detection of liquid water inside of vertically and horizontally oriented DCSSs and the detection of gas-phase water.","tags":["NDE","Nuclear","ultrasound"],"title":"Detecting Water in Dry Storage Canisters for Used Fuel","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gerges Dib","Brian J Tucker","Richard T Kouzes","Philip J Smith"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1491030000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491030000,"objectID":"1de6928a233f666433394b4aa69cc28c","permalink":"https://dibgerge.github.io/publication/2017-osti/","publishdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-osti/","section":"publication","summary":"Under certain environmental conditions, polyvinyl toluene (PVT) plastic scintillator has been observed to undergo internal fogging.

This article derives the optimal detector structure, within the framework of detection theory, based on reducing a guided wave signal at the sensor into a single feature value that can be used for comparison with a threshold. Three different types of detectors are derived depending on the underlying structure’s complexity: (a) simple structures where defect reflections can be identified without the need for baseline data; (b) simple structures that require baseline data due to overlap of defect scatter with scatter from structural features; and (c) complex structure with dense structural features that require baseline data. The detectors are derived by modeling the effects of variabilities and uncertainties as random processes. Analytical solutions for the performance of detectors in terms of the probability of detection and false alarm are derived. A finite element model that simulates guided wave inspection is used in a Monte-Carlo procedure to quantify the effects of environmental variability in terms of defect probability of detection.

In order for a GWSHM system to be reliable, it is important to investigate the ability of guided waves to detect impact damage with high probability and with a low false alarm rate. In this work, a glass fiber composite coupon with plain-weave S-glass/SC-15 epoxy is instrumented with lead-zirconate-titanate (PZT) piezoelectric thin films that are used for the generation and detection of guided waves. Baseline data is then recorded for each transducer path in the bonded GWSHM transducer network. The composite coupon is then hit by drop weight impactor with varying energies. The correlation between impact energy, observed structural damage, and the change in the guided wave signals is investigated.

System tests verify cable function under normal loads; however, the concern is over cable performance under exceptional loads associated with design-basis events (DBEs). The cable’s ability to perform safely over the initial 40-year planned and licensed life has generally been demonstrated and there have been very few age-related cable failures. With greater than 1000 km of power, control, instrumentation, and other cables typically found in an NPP, replacing all the cables would be a severe cost burden. Justification for life extension to 60 and 80 years requires a cable aging management program to justify cable performance under normal operation as well as accident conditions. Currently the gold standard for determining cable insulation degradation is the elongation-at-break (EAB). This, however, is an ex-situ measurement and requires removal of a sample for laboratory investigation. A reliable nondestructive examination (NDE) in-situ approach is desirable to objectively determine the suitability of the cable for service. A variety of tests are available to assess various aspects of electrical and mechanical cable performance, but none of these tests are suitable for all cable configurations nor does any single test confirm all features of interest. Nevertheless, the complete collection of test possibilities offers a powerful range of tools to assure the integrity of critical cables. Licensees and regulators have settled on a practical program to justify continued operation based on condition monitoring of a lead sample set of cables where test data is tracked in a database and the required test data are continually adjusted based on plant and fleet-wide experience. As part of the Light Water Reactor Sustainability program sponsored by the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the U.S. Department of Energy, and industry (represented by the Electric Power Research Institute), an assessment of cable NDE methods was commissioned. Technologies include both bulk electrical measurements (Tan δ, time domain reflectometry, frequency domain reflectometry (FDR), partial discharge, and other techniques) and local insulation measurement (indenter, dynamic mechanical analysis interdigital capacitance, infrared spectral measurement, etc.). This aging cable NDE program update reviews the full range of techniques but focuses on the most interesting test approaches that have a chance to be deployed in-situ, particularly including Tan δ, FDR, and ultrasound methods that have been reviewed most completely in this progress period.","tags":["nuclear","NDE"],"title":"Assessment of NDE for key indicators of aging cables in nuclear power plants – Interim status","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gerges Dib","Michael Larche","Aaron A Diaz","Susan L Crawford","Matthew S Prowant","Michael T Anderson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1437375600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1437375600,"objectID":"51544351997be729b33390d48e4e25de","permalink":"https://dibgerge.github.io/publication/2015-qnde/","publishdate":"2015-07-20T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-qnde/","section":"publication","summary":"Computer modeling and simulation is becoming an essential tool for transducer design and insight into ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation (UT-NDE).

This includes information about the detectability of different defect types for a given UT probe. Recently, a cooperative program between the Electrical Power Research Institute and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission was established to validate numerical modeling software commonly used for simulating UT-NDE of nuclear power plant components. In the first phase of this cooperative, extensive experimental UT measurements were conducted on machined notches with varying depth, length, and orientation in stainless steel plates. Then, the notches were modeled in CIVA, a semi-analytical NDE simulation platform developed by the French Commissariat a l’Energie Atomique, and their responses compared with the experimental measurements. Discrepancies between experimental and simulation results are due to either improper inputs to the simulation model, or to incorrect approximations and assumptions in the numerical models. To address the former, a variation study was conducted on the different parameters that are required as inputs for the model, specifically the specimen and transducer properties. Then, the ability of simulations to give accurate predictions regarding the detectability of the different defects was demonstrated. This includes the results in terms of the variations in defect amplitude indications, and the ratios between tip diffracted and specular signal amplitudes.","tags":["nuclear","ultrasound","NDE"],"title":"Experimental validation of ultrasonic NDE simulation software","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Surajit Roy","Gerges Dib","Pradeep Ramuhalli","Evelyn H Hirt","Matthew S Prowant","Lorenzo Luzi","Allan F Pardini","Stan G Pitman"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1434956400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1434956400,"objectID":"8244857b19290bb1d959d44d298c37a9","permalink":"https://dibgerge.github.io/publication/2015-phm/","publishdate":"2015-06-22T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-phm/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents recent progress towards developing a prognostic health management framework for passive components of advanced reactors (AR).

Lead-Zirconate-Titanate (PZT) thin films are becoming popular for in-situ structural health monitoring due to their small size, high piezoelectric coupling coefficient, and ease of surface-mounting and/or embedding in composite structures. A network of such transducers could be utilized for damage detection using guided wave techniques, impedance techniques, or passive impact detection techniques. However, the PZT films are subject to the same impact probabilities that the structure encounters. If the transducers fail due to the subjected impacts, they can result in false readings and ultimately failing to correctly detect damage in the structure. This paper presents a feasibility study using the guided wave S0 mode for detecting impact damage. The health of the structure is quantified using guided wave measurements, and the PZT health is monitored using impedance methods.","tags":["SHM","signal processing"],"title":"Feasibility of PZT ceramics for impact damage detection in composite structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oleksii Karpenko","Seyed Safdernejad","Gerges Dib","Lalita Udpa","Satish Udpa","Antonello Tamburrino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1405839600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1405839600,"objectID":"b74d58aaaa81c49a1a6d35a1d8236bc5","permalink":"https://dibgerge.github.io/publication/2014c-qnde/","publishdate":"2014-07-20T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2014c-qnde/","section":"publication","summary":"Eddy current probes (EC) with Giant Magnetoresistive (GMR) sensors have recently emerged as a promising tool for rapid scanning of multilayer aircraft panels that helps detect cracks under fastener heads.

However, a major issue preventing their full acceptance is the initiation of premature failure in the form of a disbond between adherends, mainly due to fatigue, manufacturing flaws or impact damage. This work presents the integrated approach for in-situ monitoring of degradation of the adhesive bond in the GFRP composite lap-joint using ultrasonic guided waves and dynamic measurements from strategically embedded FBG sensors. Guided waves are actuated with surface mounted piezoelectric elements and mode tuning is used to provide high sensitivity to the degradation of the adhesive layer parameters. Composite lap-joints are subjected to fatigue loading, and data from piezoceramic transducers are collected at regular intervals to evaluate the progression of damage. Results demonstrate that quasi-static loading affects guided wave measurements considerably, but FBG sensors can be used to monitor the applied load levels and residual strains in the adhesive bond. The proposed technique shows promise for determining the post-damage stiffness of adhesively bonded joints.","tags":["SHM","signal processing"],"title":"Multitechnique monitoring of fatigue damage in adhesively bonded composite lap-joints","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Nondestructive inspection of multi-layered airframe geometries is a significant challenge largely due to complexity of test geometry and deep lying defects. Structural geometry of interest includes different configurations of aircraft skins, stringers, doublers, wing-splice with fasteners and deep lying cracks and corrosion. Inspection of these complex geometries requires dealing with a large number of variables which affect damage detection performance (material, size, thickness, edges, air gaps, etc.), experimental sensor system (frequency, waveform shape, harmonics, sampling intervals, circuit design etc.), and defect variables (length, width, volume, shape, distribution, orientation, etc.). Combination of these classes of variables encountered in any inspection makes the interpretation of the signals very challenging.\nThe purpose of this project was to design, fabricate and test a novel transducer and inspection technique for detecting cracks near fastener sites in aircrafts with high efficiency and sensitivity. The transducer uses Giant Megnetoresistance (GMR) sensor arrays for increasing sensitivity and reducing required aircraft scan times. Also, a rotating coil excitation is used, which allows the probe to be uniformly sensitive to cracks oriented in arbitrary direction. This is a significant advancement over the previous state-of-the-art, where probes were only sensitive to cracks oriented parallel to the direction of coil current flow. A finite element model (FEM) was also developed for simulating the designed probes. FEM simulations were then used for optimizing the probe design, including GMR sensor placement, excitation coil parameters, and signal processing methods.\n","date":1404198000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1404198000,"objectID":"6b8e2c4092b3d25738d6ba0d0ee5e184","permalink":"https://dibgerge.github.io/project/gmr/","publishdate":"2014-07-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/project/gmr/","section":"project","summary":"Building sensor systems for reliable detection of fatigue cracks in multilayered aircraft fuselage.","tags":["NDE","signal processing"],"title":"Giant Magnetoresistance Sensors for Aircraft Inspection","type":"project"},{"authors":["Gerges Dib","Oleksii Karpenko","Mahmoodul Haq","Lalita Udpa","Satish Udpa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388563200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388563200,"objectID":"9bcf3215ecb656d700aaf797e688d0b4","permalink":"https://dibgerge.github.io/publication/2014-icons/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00-08:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2014-icons/","section":"publication","summary":"Damage detection using Lead-Zirconate-Titanate (PZT) transducers for exciting guided waves was investigated.

However, a major problem in guided wave NDE is the presence of multiple propagation modes at any actuation frequency that travel with different velocities and interfere with each other which makes interpretation of GW signals complicated. Decomposition of the measured signal into its constituent components is a critical requirement for accurate analysis in terms of detection, location and characterization of structural defects. This paper addresses the above problem using a new two-stage Mode Decomposition (MD) algorithm. The first stage employs fast high-resolution Time-Frequency Representation (TFR) of the signal based on Reassigned Spectrogram with Chirp Transform kernel (RSCT), which is used for preprocessing. The second stage includes efficiently implemented Matching Pursuit with dispersion-based dictionary. The performance of the algorithm is demonstrated on 2-mm thick aluminum plates with surface-bonded piezoelectric wafer sensors. The results show that the algorithm identifies the modes and separates closely spaced or overlapped S0 and A0 wave packets. Automated analysis of the MD output allows for detection of flaw indications corresponding to different modes using standard diagnostic imaging algorithm.","tags":["SHM","signal processing"],"title":"Novel Mode Decomposition Algorithms for Lamb Wave Signal Analysis in Online Monitoring of Structures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guang Yang","Zhiwei Zeng","Yiming Deng","Xin Liu","Gerges Dib","Lalita Udpa"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1351753200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1351753200,"objectID":"80a8e3e207aa170441a4b1e6b0af07c4","permalink":"https://dibgerge.github.io/publication/2012-ndte/","publishdate":"2012-11-01T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2012-ndte/","section":"publication","summary":"In the application of electromagnetic nondestructive evaluation (NDE), the measured signals received by sensors are decided by the flaw associated with operational parameters during inspection.

A novel invariance analysis of eddy current (EC) signals in the inspection of deeply embedded cracks under layered fastener heads has been presented in this paper. A detection system based on uniform EC excitation and giant-magnetoresistive (GMR) pick-up sensors has been developed and shown improved detectability of 2nd and 3rd layer defects around fastener sites in multilayer structures. However, the sensor-tilt due to variation of probe lift-off can generate redundant response as noise effect and obscure the flaw inspection. The variations of GMR sensor-tilt with crack inspection are investigated using an efficient numerical model that simulates the used EC-GMR system. The scheme of invariance transformation is proposed to exclude the sensor-tilt noise and keep the defect inspection identical. The statistical features insensitive to tilt effects are extracted after the invariance processing, which has ensured the probability of flaw detection.","tags":["NDE"],"title":"Sensor-tilt invariance analysis for eddy current signals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Guang Yang","Tariq Khan","Lu Zhang","Gerges Dib","Junjun Xin","Lalita Udpa","Shantanu Majumdar","Satish Udpa","Jaejoon Kim"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1346828400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1346828400,"objectID":"8be27c828f669c9a5e6ca77fdcdc92fa","permalink":"https://dibgerge.github.io/publication/2011-isaem/","publishdate":"2012-09-05T00:00:00-07:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2011-isaem/","section":"publication","summary":"An advanced nonlinear, non-stationary signal processing algorithm using Hilbert-Huang Transform is presented for automatic analysis of eddy current data collected during the inspection of steam generator tubes in nuclear power plants.
