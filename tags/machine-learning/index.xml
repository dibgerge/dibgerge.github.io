      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine intelligence advances have elevated the potential of computer-based video analytics but machines alone still fall short of human visual recognition capabilities. Humans, however, cannot address the high volumes of data in need of analysis. Despite exponential growth in machine analytics, opportunities for improvement remain (reducing training sets, improving cross-platform compatibility, adapting to changing environments, etc.). This project aims at achieving higher performance thresholds by integrating the strengths of human and machine reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently building brain-computer interfaces and machine learning approaches to quantify neurological data reflecting fast visual recognition collected with an electroencephalogram (EEG) headset worn by a human participant viewing video data. The quality of psychological engagement are being investigated and the quality of EEG signatures are being evaluated based on reproducibility and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NIML approach is envisaged to significantly enhance data processing with application to HIL processes that could benefit big data problems such as data labeling for medicine, social media, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Machine Learning and Statistical Signal Processing for Guided Wave Structural Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://dibgerge.github.io/project/gwshm/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sparse ultrasonic guided waves sensor networks would increase safety and reduce maintenance costs of current civil and industrial structures by providing continuous information about structural health. Common damage modalities that are of concern include fatigue cracks and corrosion in metals, and delaminations and impact damage in composite materials. Ultrasonic guided wave testing is used in various industries due to its superior ability to rapidly inspect large areas in thin structures. Guided waves travel long distances and interrogate the entire thickness of a structure. These properties make guided waves of interest in structural health monitoring (SHM) since a small number of transducers is required to monitor a large structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the complexity of guided wave signals, detection strategies in guided wave SHM often are based on detecting changes in the signals based on reference signals collected when the structure is in its pristine state. Damage detection is challenging because there are multitude of other factors that affect the signal such as sensor aging, temperature changes, humidity, and/or varying loading conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this project, we developed machine learning and statistical signal processing techniques for building reliable and efficient methods for damage classification in structures under varying environmental and operating conditions. In addition, we developed statistical methods for quantifying the probability of detection due to sensor aging and variations in environmental and operating condition.&lt;/p&gt;
