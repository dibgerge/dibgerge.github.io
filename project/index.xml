      <description>Machine intelligence advances have elevated the potential of computer-based video analytics but machines alone still fall short of human visual recognition capabilities. Humans, however, cannot address the high volumes of data in need of analysis. Despite exponential growth in machine analytics, opportunities for improvement remain (reducing training sets, improving cross-platform compatibility, adapting to changing environments, etc.). This project aims at achieving higher performance thresholds by integrating the strengths of human and machine reasoning.</description>

      <description>Non-destructive evaluation and testing (NDE) is essential for ensuring the safety of operational nuclear power plants around the world. Ultrasonic testing is an NDE technique which is largely utilized for inspecting pipelines in the nuclear industry due to its ability to detect flaws hidden within the inner diameter of pipelines.
Computer modeling and simulation is becoming an essential tool for transducer design and insight into ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation. For computational models to be of use in practical situations, it is important to develop techniques for inferring the reliability of inspections using simulated results.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning and Statistical Signal Processing for Guided Wave Structural Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://dibgerge.github.io/project/gwshm/</link>

      <description>Sparse ultrasonic guided waves sensor networks would increase safety and reduce maintenance costs of current civil and industrial structures by providing continuous information about structural health. Common damage modalities that are of concern include fatigue cracks and corrosion in metals, and delaminations and impact damage in composite materials. Ultrasonic guided wave testing is used in various industries due to its superior ability to rapidly inspect large areas in thin structures. Guided waves travel long distances and interrogate the entire thickness of a structure.</description>

      <description>Nondestructive inspection of multi-layered airframe geometries is a significant challenge largely due to complexity of test geometry and deep lying defects. Structural geometry of interest includes different configurations of aircraft skins, stringers, doublers, wing-splice with fasteners and deep lying cracks and corrosion. Inspection of these complex geometries requires dealing with a large number of variables which affect damage detection performance (material, size, thickness, edges, air gaps, etc.), experimental sensor system (frequency, waveform shape, harmonics, sampling intervals, circuit design etc.</description>

      <title>Eddy Current Inspection Autoanalysis of Steam Generator Tubes in Nuclear Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://dibgerge.github.io/project/autoanalysis/</link>

      <description>Processing pipeline for autoanalysis software.
   
Steam generators (SG) are heat exchanger units used in nuclear power plants. Each SG unit typically contains 10000 - 20000 tubes which are exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as high temperatures, high pressures, high fluid flow rates and material interactions resulting in various types of tube degradations - mechanical wear, stress corrosion cracking (SCC), pitting, volumetric degradation, inter granular attack (IGA), loose parts and denting.</description>

      <description>Schematic of sensor network with centralized architecture.
   
The use of wireless sensor networks in structural health monitoring can significantly increase safety and reduce manufacturing and maintenance costs. In this project, we integrate guided wave sensors with wireless sensor modules for continuous monitoring of civil structures. The wireless sensors eliminate the need for cables, reducing overall structure weight (especially important in aerospace industry) and single points of failure.</description>
