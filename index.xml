      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine intelligence advances have elevated the potential of computer-based video analytics but machines alone still fall short of human visual recognition capabilities. Humans, however, cannot address the high volumes of data in need of analysis. Despite exponential growth in machine analytics, opportunities for improvement remain (reducing training sets, improving cross-platform compatibility, adapting to changing environments, etc.). This project aims at achieving higher performance thresholds by integrating the strengths of human and machine reasoning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are currently building brain-computer interfaces and machine learning approaches to quantify neurological data reflecting fast visual recognition collected with an electroencephalogram (EEG) headset worn by a human participant viewing video data. The quality of psychological engagement are being investigated and the quality of EEG signatures are being evaluated based on reproducibility and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The NIML approach is envisaged to significantly enhance data processing with application to HIL processes that could benefit big data problems such as data labeling for medicine, social media, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Validation of Ultrasound NDE Simulation Models</title>
      <link>https://dibgerge.github.io/project/ut-modeling/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondestructive_testing&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Non-destructive evaluation and testing (NDE)&lt;/a&gt; is essential for ensuring the safety of operational nuclear power plants around the world. Ultrasonic testing is an NDE technique which is largely utilized for inspecting pipelines in the nuclear industry due to its ability to detect flaws hidden within the inner diameter of pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Computer modeling and simulation is becoming an essential tool for transducer design and insight into ultrasonic nondestructive evaluation. For computational models to be of use in practical situations, it is important to develop techniques for inferring the reliability of inspections using simulated results. This includes information about the detectability of different defect types within different material varying in complexity and grain structure. To address this problem, we need to develop techniques to quantify confidence in simulations, and methods to incorporate experimental and structural noise into model outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we are building a large database of ultrasound inspection empirical data using different types of probes, materials, and defects. We are using this empirical data to: (1) Develop techniques for validating ultrasound inspection simulations; (2) Uncertainty quantification due to uncertain or unknown simulation input parameters; and (3) Develop noise models which can be fused with simulation data for analyzing inspection reliability using simulated data.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Machine Learning and Statistical Signal Processing for Guided Wave Structural Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://dibgerge.github.io/project/gwshm/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sparse ultrasonic guided waves sensor networks would increase safety and reduce maintenance costs of current civil and industrial structures by providing continuous information about structural health. Common damage modalities that are of concern include fatigue cracks and corrosion in metals, and delaminations and impact damage in composite materials. Ultrasonic guided wave testing is used in various industries due to its superior ability to rapidly inspect large areas in thin structures. Guided waves travel long distances and interrogate the entire thickness of a structure. These properties make guided waves of interest in structural health monitoring (SHM) since a small number of transducers is required to monitor a large structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the complexity of guided wave signals, detection strategies in guided wave SHM often are based on detecting changes in the signals based on reference signals collected when the structure is in its pristine state. Damage detection is challenging because there are multitude of other factors that affect the signal such as sensor aging, temperature changes, humidity, and/or varying loading conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project, we developed machine learning and statistical signal processing techniques for building reliable and efficient methods for damage classification in structures under varying environmental and operating conditions. In addition, we developed statistical methods for quantifying the probability of detection due to sensor aging and variations in environmental and operating condition.&lt;/p&gt;
